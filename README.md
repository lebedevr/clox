# ⚙️ Lox Bytecode Virtual Machine (clox)

This is the **C-based bytecode interpreter and virtual machine** for the Lox programming language, built by following [*Crafting Interpreters*](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

**clox** compiles Lox source code into bytecode and executes it on a custom **stack-based virtual machine (VM)** — providing deep insight into how real-world interpreters and VMs work under the hood.

## 📘 Overview

**clox** is a minimalist, high-performance implementation of the Lox language written entirely in C.  
It demonstrates the essential components of a programming language runtime, including bytecode compilation, stack-based execution, and memory management with garbage collection.
